🎯 Problem We’re Solving

Students constantly ask the same questions:

“When are the exams?”
“Where do I submit forms?”
“Who do I contact for fee issues?”
“What is the timetable?”

Teachers & admin spend time answering repeating questions.
👉 Campus QueryBot automates this.


🤖 What is Campus QueryBot?

Campus QueryBot is a college helpdesk chatbot that:

✔ Answers only from verified FAQs stored in database
✔ Prevents wrong or random answers
✔ Gives reliable guidance
✔ Shows admin-approved responses

If an answer is missing, it politely says:
“Please contact the college administration.”
